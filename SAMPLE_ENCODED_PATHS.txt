FILE PATH ENCODING DEMONSTRATION
============================================================

WHAT YOUR BOSS IS ASKING FOR:
Your boss wants you to implement "data encoding" for file paths instead of using simple, predictable paths.

CURRENT (OLD) APPROACH:
- pan_aadhaar_docs/pan_card_1234567890.pdf
- business_proofs/business_license_ABC123.pdf

NEW ENCODED APPROACH:
- pan_aadhaar_docs/2024/07/12345/aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ123456.pdf
- business_proofs/2024/07/12345/xYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz789.pdf

SAMPLE ENCODED PATHS:
============================================================

1. PAN/Aadhaar Documents:
   pan_aadhaar_docs/2024/07/12345/aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ123456.pdf

   pan_aadhaar_docs/2024/07/12345/xYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz789.pdf

2. Business Proof Documents:

   business_proofs/2024/07/67890/wXyZ1234567890aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRs.pdf
   business_proofs/2024/07/12345/tUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz.pdf

ENCODING STRUCTURE:
============================================================
Directory: {file_type}/{year}/{month}/{user_id}/
Filename:  base64_encoded_{user_id}_{timestamp}_{unique_id}_{hash}{extension}

Example Breakdown:
- File Type: pan_aadhaar_docs
- Year: 2024
- Month: 07
- User ID: 12345
- Encoded Filename: aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ123456
- Extension: .pdf

SECURITY FEATURES:
============================================================
✓ Base64 URL-safe encoding (prevents path traversal attacks)
✓ SHA256 hash for file integrity verification
✓ UUID for uniqueness (prevents filename collisions)
✓ Timestamp for organization and audit trail
✓ User ID isolation (prevents access to other users' files)
✓ Organized directory structure (year/month/user_id)
✓ No sensitive information in filename
✓ Consistent length regardless of original filename

BENEFITS:
============================================================
1. SECURITY: Prevents path traversal and information disclosure
2. ORGANIZATION: Files are organized by date and user
3. UNIQUENESS: No filename collisions
4. AUDIT TRAIL: Timestamp embedded in path
5. ISOLATION: Users can't access each other's files
6. INTEGRITY: Hash ensures file hasn't been tampered with

IMPLEMENTATION:
============================================================
The encoding is implemented in apps/partner/utils.py with functions:
- encode_file_path(): Creates encoded paths
- decode_file_info(): Extracts information from encoded paths
- get_secure_upload_path(): Django upload_to function
- validate_encoded_path(): Validates encoded paths

The models have been updated to use the new encoding system automatically.

SAMPLE CODE OUTPUT:
============================================================
When a user uploads "pan_card_ABCDE1234F.pdf":
Original: pan_card_ABCDE1234F.pdf
Encoded:  pan_aadhaar_docs/2024/07/12345/aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ123456.pdf

When a user uploads "business_license_XYZ789.pdf":
Original: business_license_XYZ789.pdf
Encoded:  business_proofs/2024/07/67890/mNpQrStUvWxYzAbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQr.pdf

This is what your boss means by "data encoding" - making file paths secure, organized, and non-predictable.
