# Legal Banking API Performance Optimization Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Slow File Upload Performance**: The legal-banking API was taking 4-5 seconds for 1-2MB image uploads
2. **Admin Image Display**: Images were not properly displayed in Django admin interface

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. File Upload Settings Optimization

**File**: `config/settings.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Reduced `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` from 10MB to 2MB for faster processing
- Reduced `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` from 10MB to 2MB for faster processing
- Added `FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR` for efficient temporary file handling
- Added proper file permissions configuration

```python
# File upload settings - Optimized for performance
FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024  # 2MB - Reduced for faster processing
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024   # 2MB - Reduced for faster processing
FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR = BASE_DIR / 'temp'  # Temporary directory for file processing
FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644  # File permissions
FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS = 0o755  # Directory permissions
```

### 2. Optimized File Upload Handler

**File**: `apps/partner/utils.py`

**New Features**:
- Added `optimize_file_upload()` function for efficient file handling
- Added performance monitoring with `log_performance_metric()`
- Uses Django's default storage for efficient file handling
- Added error handling and logging

```python
def optimize_file_upload(file_obj, user_id, file_type):
    """Optimized file upload with performance monitoring."""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    try:
        # Generate secure path
        encoded_path = get_secure_upload_path(None, file_obj.name)
        
        # Use Django's default storage for efficient file handling
        file_path = default_storage.save(encoded_path, ContentFile(file_obj.read()))
        
        # Log performance
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        log_performance_metric(f"File upload ({file_type})", duration, file_obj.size)
        
        return file_path
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"File upload error: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

### 3. Enhanced Legal Banking View

**File**: `apps/partner/views.py`

**Improvements**:
- Added performance monitoring with timing
- Optimized file upload processing
- Better error handling for file uploads
- Separate handling for different file types (PAN/Aadhaar vs Business Proof)

**Key Changes**:
```python
def legal_banking_view(request):
    """Get or update legal and banking information."""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Handle file uploads efficiently
    data = request.data.copy()
    
    # Process file uploads if present
    if 'panOrAadhaarFile' in request.FILES:
        file_obj = request.FILES['panOrAadhaarFile']
        try:
            optimized_path = optimize_file_upload(file_obj, partner.user.id, 'pan_aadhaar_docs')
            data['pan_or_aadhaar_file'] = optimized_path
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"PAN/Aadhaar file upload error: {str(e)}")
            return Response({
                'success': False,
                'message': f'File upload failed: {str(e)}'
            }, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
    
    # ... rest of the optimized code ...
```

### 4. Django Admin Image Display Enhancement

**File**: `apps/partner/admin.py`

**New Features**:
- Added `get_file_preview()` method for image display
- Shows image thumbnails for image files
- Shows download links for PDF files
- Added file preview to list display and readonly fields

```python
def get_file_preview(self, obj):
    """Display file preview in admin."""
    preview_html = []
    
    if obj.pan_or_aadhaar_file:
        file_url = obj.pan_or_aadhaar_file.url
        file_name = obj.pan_or_aadhaar_file.name.split('/')[-1]
        file_ext = file_name.split('.')[-1].lower()
        
        if file_ext in ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']:
            preview_html.append(
                f'<div style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>PAN/Aadhaar:</strong><br>'
                f'<img src="{file_url}" style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 150px; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 5px;" />'
                f'<br><small>{file_name}</small></div>'
            )
        else:
            preview_html.append(
                f'<div style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>PAN/Aadhaar:</strong><br>'
                f'<a href="{file_url}" target="_blank">{file_name}</a></div>'
            )
    
    # Similar handling for business_proof_file
    
    return format_html(''.join(preview_html))
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- **File Upload Time**: 4-5 seconds for 1-2MB images
- **Memory Usage**: High due to 10MB buffer
- **Admin Display**: No image previews

### After Optimization:
- **File Upload Time**: Expected 1-2 seconds for 1-2MB images (50-75% improvement)
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced by 80% (2MB vs 10MB buffer)
- **Admin Display**: Full image previews with thumbnails

## Testing Tools Created

### 1. Performance Test Script
**File**: `test_legal_banking_performance.py`

**Features**:
- Tests upload performance with different file sizes
- Measures response times
- Tests multiple file uploads
- Generates test images of specified sizes

### 2. Admin Image Check Script
**File**: `check_admin_images.py`

**Features**:
- Verifies media file configuration
- Checks file existence and permissions
- Tests admin preview functionality
- Provides recommendations for admin setup

## Usage Instructions

### Running Performance Tests:
```bash
python test_legal_banking_performance.py
```

### Checking Admin Images:
```bash
python check_admin_images.py
```

### Starting the Server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. For Production:
- Consider using a CDN for file storage
- Implement file compression for images
- Add file type validation on frontend
- Consider async file processing for large files

### 2. For Development:
- Monitor performance logs for file uploads
- Use the performance test script regularly
- Check admin interface for proper image display

### 3. Monitoring:
- Performance metrics are now logged with `log_performance_metric()`
- Check Django logs for upload performance data
- Monitor file storage usage

## Files Modified

1. `config/settings.py` - File upload optimization
2. `apps/partner/utils.py` - Added optimized file upload handler
3. `apps/partner/views.py` - Enhanced legal banking view with performance monitoring
4. `apps/partner/admin.py` - Added image preview functionality
5. `test_legal_banking_performance.py` - Performance testing script
6. `check_admin_images.py` - Admin image verification script

## Next Steps

1. **Test the optimizations** with the performance test script
2. **Verify admin image display** by uploading files and checking the admin interface
3. **Monitor performance** in production environment
4. **Consider additional optimizations** based on real-world usage patterns

The optimizations should significantly improve the file upload performance and provide a much better admin experience for viewing uploaded images.
